    Now --slave=(slave address) function can work properly.
- Using service layer with dll
    merged serviceLayer and srv. Also removed the srv project
- Fixd bugs which can cause crahs with Windows OS, climax 32 bit application.
- Updated I2C interface to be used for Linux 32bit.

v1.1, climax v3.1, srv v1.8, tfa v3.5, hal 2.5 (2014-wk23)

v1.0, climax v3.0, srv v1.7, tfa v3.4, hal 2.5 (2014-wk13)
SC39371: SW: replace scons with andriode make for API and Climax
-- removed all the linux makefile. Andriod.mk is still used and linux uses scons. 
SC39534: implement and test the service layer
-- implemented header and container file functionality in service layer
-- consolidated key functionality within tfa98xxRuntime and tfaContainer (driver handling) 
-- printing of container file content occurs ONLY when -l and -b option and not in combination with other commands. 
-- all climax commands need container file
-- basic Win x64 build
SC39599: add calculation fucntion for the DRC threshold values in SRV layer
SC40904: implement C code for EQ and DRC conversion
-- introduced tfa98xxDRC.c for DRC parameter handling 
SC43453: cleanup unused sample rate in eq file
> --save function where filename.type.bin is needed.
- SC39508 add customer info fields and container file management
-- Due to container file introduction, number of climax commands are obolete or re-defined
- SC40922 write re0 for Tfa9895 device
- SC40107 coding style improvements
-- split the tfa functionality into files tfaAPI.[hc] and tfa98xx.[hc]. The tfa98xx.[hc] conforms to linux coding style. 

v0.5 release, climax v2.5, srv v1.6, tfa v3.2, hal 2.4 (2013-wk45):
- SC42653 : Added header implementation and vstep implementation.
            Using tfaContainer.c implementation for the header implementation and handling of vstep file.
            Added loading vstep implementation in nxpTfa98xx.c.
            Synchronized implementation of using parameter file with header to example code.
- SC40346 : Added saving/loading DRC contents by climax.
- Updated the implementation for sleep time for windows for correct 1ms calculation.

v0.4 release, climax v2.3, srv v1.5, tfa v3.1, hal 2.4 (2013-wk47):
- Updated patch file.
- Fixed the wrong comment of register DCMCC.
- Naming convention of DSP bypass function for kernel usage.
- Aligned example code with run time service layer code of coldstartup.

v0.3 release, climax v2.3, srv v1.4, tfa v3.0, hal 2.4 (2013-wk45):
- SC41151: Added implementation to set PLL to double locking frequency to solve PLL not stable issue.
- SC41800: Added the assigning of value for short on Mips.
- SC41151: Updated the start up sequence to put DSP to reset state before power up device.
- SC38987: DSP bypass function for TFA98xx
    The DSP bypass will also bypass the battery safeguard. Note: in the current implementation only 8 ohm speaker is supported.
- SC39766: Removed the unnecessary register definition for dummy.
    Updated register definitions.

v0.2 BETA release, climax v2.3, srv v1.3, tfa v3.0, hal 2.4 (2013-wk39):
- SC40492: Update example code to use service layer code.
    Service layer is separated and implemented in srv/ 
    Added app/exTfa98xx/src/stereo_app.c for stereo service layer example
- SC40382: replace logarithmic function in calcBiquadCoeff() with bit operation
- SC40107: for coding style conform to checkpatch.pl guidelines
    The basic Linux coding style is applied to TFA API layer. The CamelCase and typeDef warnings are ignored.     
    This functional changes and impacts many customer. The proper solution is to implement a wrapper for API.
    This will be investigated as preparation for Linux driver development in Q4. 
- SC38987: DSP bypass function for 9887
    This functionality is under test for beta release.
- SC40045: Floating point arithmetic from API
    Moved the FP to service layer. This is intermediate solution. 
    The proper solution is to remove FP values from the file and replace with values to send directly to device.
    This to be investigated in next release and requires major upgrade of Pico and device files. 
- SC40383: incorporate feedback from customer into API code
    Reduce number of warnings. Improve code readability.
- SC39508: add customer info fields and container file management
    Preparation for header introduction in parameter files    
- SC39750: For --calshow, tCoefA is printed only when in verbose mode
    
nxpTfaHost SW v0.1, climax v2.2, srv v1.2, tfa v2.9, hal 2.3 (2013-wk35):
- SC39371               SW: replace scons with andriode make for API and Climax
- SC39455               SW: replace the current API folder struc and merge climax and introduce makefile for builds      
    - The old API software and the Climax sotware is merged into one software tree call the NXP TFA Host Software
    - The new layout folders and source code is explained in doc/README.txt
- SC39750               HTC requests tcoefA reading     
    - tfa98xxGetTcoefA function introduced in tfa98xxCalibration.c in service layer
- SC39765               enhanced dummy for 95
    - can simulate Tfa9895 device via -ddummy in climax
- SC39470               climax: Loading config file for different devices
    - deployed and implemented a function that returns the actual config size in nxpTfa98xx.c in service layer

FOR OLD API LAYOUT
==================
API version is 2.7 and HAL version is 2.2 (2013-wk30):
- SC39368: fix the Tfa98xxStereo example build and test it
- SC39063: remove Release64 and Debug64 from API build configuration for MS VS 2010 Windows build
- All registers and bit definitions are generated and implemented in the code. (Tfa98xx_genregs.h). This is partly related to SC38737.
- Tfa98xx_DspReset function added for control DSP reset state.  
   checks AREFS, CLKS amd MTPB when coldstarted 
   checks AMPS when warm
- if-def macros for generating individual releases.
- call Tfa98xx_DspSystemStable in checkICROMversion to check if DSP subsys is ready
- extraction script update for building and testing on linux and windows
- removed inttypes.h , replaced by stdint.h
- temporarily disabled translate i2c error, requires enhancement of erro handling
- introduce API dll build in MS VS 2010
- updated the API installer to include documentation
- API installer does not automatically install scribo. seperate scribo installer handled this.
- seperate build of HAL and API is done
- Tfa98xx/lib and Tfa98xx_hal/lib contain the linux x64 library binaries. Pleaes build API and HAL using scons to create library in other platforms 

TFA9890
- Tfa98xx_genregs.h also contains TFA9890 specific definitions, these need to go to a seperate TFA9890 only include.
- Added TFA9890 specifics implementations and wrappers for Tfa98xx_DspReset and Tfa98xx_DspSystemStable.
- Tfa9890_DspReset
   temporarily disables clock gating for DSP_reset
- Tfa9890_DspSystemStable
   extra check for the contents of non-zero in TMP registers to mark the subsystem ready (refer to TFA9890 datasheet)
- update initTfa90N1B12.c with new  specifics

TFA9887B
- Added as new device. This is replacement for 95. 95 is 87B with DRC feature. 

TFA9895
- This device has been removed as a named type. (replaced by TFA9887B)
- The DRC feature is enabled whenever the feature is reported to be supported by the device

HAL
- The HAL now directly communicate with the Scribo dll and the crdi2c32.dll has become obsolete. 
  In order to achieve this the low level interface was changed, this means that the slave address as 
  the 1st parameter and the buffer starts with the sub address.
 
Examples
- the new functions from runtime (service layer) are used in the coldstart 
- removed scanning for devices (hardcoded for device 0x36 on devkit)
- fixed and renamed exTfa98xxStereo
- exTfa98xxStereo does not calibrate, it expects calibrated devices
- removed exTfa9887 and exCli (unused)
- Removed DSP reset code from setOtc function


Tests:
- performed extraction of Tfa9890 code and executed the examples (mono and stereo) on Linux x64 and Windows/Cygwin x64
- API tested on Andriod (panda board) via climax 
- tested on Rasberry Pi ARM Linux x32
